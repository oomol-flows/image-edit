# Traditional Image Processing Task Blocks

A comprehensive collection of **traditional image processing** task blocks for the OOMOL platform. These reusable components provide powerful conventional image editing capabilities that can be combined into custom workflows.

> **Note**: This is a traditional image processing toolkit that uses conventional image processing algorithms. It does **NOT** use AI or machine learning features. For AI-powered image processing capabilities, please use dedicated AI image processing task blocks instead.

## Available Task Blocks

### Image Transformation
- **Resize** - Adjust image dimensions with various fitting modes (cover, contain, fill, inside, outside)
- **Crop** - Extract specific regions from images
- **Rotate** - Rotate images by specified angles
- **Flip** - Flip images vertically
- **Flop** - Flip images horizontally

### Visual Effects
- **Blur** - Apply Gaussian blur effects with adjustable intensity (0.3-1000)
- **Sharpen** - Enhance image sharpness and clarity
- **Brightness** - Adjust image brightness levels
- **Contrast** - Modify image contrast
- **Gamma** - Apply gamma correction
- **Saturation** - Control color saturation intensity
- **Hue** - Adjust color hue values

### Color Processing
- **Greyscale** - Convert images to grayscale
- **Sepia** - Apply vintage sepia tone effects
- **Negative** - Create negative/inverted color effects

### Content Operations
- **Watermark** - Add watermarks with customizable position, opacity, and scale
- **Format Convert** - Convert between different image formats

## Features

### Easy Integration
- **Drag & Drop Interface**: Visual workflow builder with intuitive connections
- **Type Safety**: Built-in input validation and type checking
- **File Handling**: Native support for file selection and output saving

### Flexible Configuration
- **Adjustable Parameters**: Fine-tune effects with range controls and presets
- **Multiple Formats**: Support for various image formats (JPEG, PNG, WebP, etc.)
- **Batch Processing**: Chain multiple operations together

### Professional Quality
- **High Performance**: Optimized traditional image processing algorithms
- **Precision Control**: Accurate parameter ranges for professional results
- **Memory Efficient**: Streamlined processing for large images
- **Traditional Methods**: Uses established computer vision and signal processing techniques (no AI/ML)

## Usage

Each task block is designed as a self-contained unit that can be:

1. **Used Independently**: Apply single effects to images
2. **Chained Together**: Create complex processing pipelines
3. **Configured Dynamically**: Adjust parameters based on workflow needs
4. **Reused Across Projects**: Import and use in multiple OOMOL workflows

## Technical Details

- **Runtime**: Node.js TypeScript execution
- **Input/Output**: File-based with UI widget integration
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation and error reporting
- **Performance**: Non-blocking async processing

## Getting Started

1. Select task blocks from the available collection
2. Configure input parameters through the visual interface
3. Connect blocks to create your desired processing pipeline
4. Execute workflows to process your images

These traditional image processing task blocks provide a foundation for building sophisticated conventional image editing applications within the OOMOL ecosystem, using proven algorithms and techniques without AI dependencies.
